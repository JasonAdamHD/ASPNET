            <h2>I often drone on about HTML being a semantic language.  What do I mean, and how does this affect the way HTML should be written</h2>
            <p>What is meant is that the tags used should have meaning, such as using a strong tag instead of a bold tag. This affects the way we write HTML because we should use the tags the way they were designed to be used, rather than just using what makes the webpage look nice.</p>

Explain what types of registrations happen in each of these sections of the file.</h2>
            <p>The builder var builds the builder so that we create and have access to the configuration options. We can add different services to the builder at this point such as adding controllers with views, transients, and changing config options. Building the builder returns a webapp that has the applied changes and will be used to run the app.</p>
